## ip adresses, versions 4 and 6
back in the days, we had IPv4, a network routing system consisted of addresses made up of four bytes. commonly written in this form: `192.168.0.1`.
then we ran out of IP addresses. a 32-bit IPv4 address could not handle IP addresses assignment anymore. so IPv6 was born.
IPv6 is basically `2^128` so that's a lot. in fact, 340 trillion trillion trillion numbers. yeah, a lot. they are represented as hexadecimal numbers with each two-byte chunk separated by `:`.
e.g.: `2001:0db8:c9d2:aee5:73e3:934a:a5ae:9551`
