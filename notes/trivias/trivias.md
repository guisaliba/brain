anything interesting enough that deserves a writing is considered a trivia.
it can be of any kind, subject and topics as long as it sparkles the "i should write about that" or "i want to remember about this later on" thinking.

if it's knowledge that should be retained, it should be written. if it doesn't fit any other subject but fits on the above criteria, than it's a **trivia**.
