The AT Protocol stands for "Authenticated Transfer Protocol," and is frequently shortened to "atproto."
The name is in reference to the fact that all user-data is signed by the authoring users, which makes it possible to broadcast the data through many services and prove it's real without having to speak directly to the originating server.

The name is also a play on the "@" symbol, aka the "at" symbol, since atproto is designed for social systems.

The "Atmosphere" is the term we use to describe the ecosystem around the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#at-protocol).
