Understand theory first;
Read the docs:
 - Ethereum, Solidity, OpenZeppelion, Ethers, Wagmi, Viem;
ERC patterns;
Security;
Development environments:
 - Remix: remix.ethereum.org
 - Hardhat: hardhat.org

Blockchain cryptography:
 - ECDSA, RSA, etc.
Understand how a Blockchain (EVM) works;
Smart contracts;

Study path:
Ethereum (theory) > Solidity > ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155 > Deisgn patterns (proxy etc.) > Crypto/Hash

Security:
 - Understand and follow best practices, no need to delay your development because of it;
 - Study vulnerabilities: Reentrancy, signature malleability, transaction replaying.
