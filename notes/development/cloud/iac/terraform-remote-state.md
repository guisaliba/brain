### What does `terraform_remote_state` represent?

Think of the `terraform_remote_state` data source as a **read-only window into another Terraform configuration's outputs**.
1. **State Files**: When you run `terraform apply`, Terraform creates a **state file** that acts as a map of the resources it manages.
2. **Outputs**: You can declare `output` values in your Terraform code. These outputs are stored in the state file and are designed to expose important information to the outside world.
3. **The Data Source**: The `data "terraform_remote_state"` block tells the Terraform configuration below to connect to an S3 bucket, find the state file for _another_ configuration (`graphway_api`), and read the `output` values from it.

``` Terraform
data "terraform_remote_state" "graphway_api" {
	backend = "s3"
	config = {
		bucket = var.settings.state_bucket
		key = var.settings.state_key_base
		region = var.settings.aws_region	
	}
}
```

It doesn't create any new infrastructure. Its only job is to **fetch data** that already exists.

Using `terraform_remote_state` is the standard, most robust Terraform-native way to pass data from a component to another,for a few key reasons:

- **It Creates a Direct Dependency**: It makes the dependency between your components explicit in the code. Anyone reading the `graphway_proxy` code can see that it depends on outputs from `graphway_api`.
- **It's Dynamic**: If a component is updated and the resource e.g.: an SQS queue is recreated with a new ARN, the next time you run `terraform apply` for that component, it will automatically fetch the _new_ ARN. You don't have to manually update variables.

where to place it?
- **`variables.tf` is for input**: This file is strictly for declaring **input variables**—the values you expect to be passed _into_ your configuration from the outside (e.g., from your `automation.sh` script or a CI/CD pipeline). It defines the "API" of your Terraform module.
- **Data sources are for fetching data**: A `data` block is not an input variable. It's an active piece of your configuration that performs a read operation during the Terraform run. Placing it in a `variables.tf` would be semantically incorrect and confusing.

We could create a new file like `data.tf` for it, which is also a common pattern. 
1. The `terraform_remote_state` data source is used to get information about resources that are part of the overall network architecture connecting your components.
2. you can either create a new file like the aforementioned, or place it anywhere else that already have other `data` and/or `resource` blocks declared.

in short, you put `data` blocks with other `resource` blocks in logical files ([network.tf](vscode-file://vscode-app/opt/visual-studio-code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html), `lambda.tf`, etc.), while `variables.tf` is reserved exclusively for defining the inputs your configuration accepts.
