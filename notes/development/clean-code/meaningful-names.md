things should be named well, because things are everywhere: variables, functions, arguments, classes, packages, files, directories, etc. all of them should be named well.

names should reveal intent, seriously, and that may take time. the name of a variable, function or class should answer these questions:
1. why does it exist;
2. what does it do;
3. how it is used;
if a name requires a comment, then it is not revealing its intent.
