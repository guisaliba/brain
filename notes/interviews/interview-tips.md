Market salaries expectations (BRL at BR):

3-6/7 (JR)
8-11 (PL)
11-16/17 (SR)

To every question, try to apply the S.T.A.R. framework: what was the designated task to me, what happened before (context) the task, what did I do to accomplish it (approach, hands-on, development and solution building) and then what was the result after I took action on it.

For technical interviews, focus more on the ACTION part of the storytelling rather than the task or result. 

Speak about what I did, how I built it, what the solution I built did, some validations I had to consider while building it, maybe why I chose that approach and what I identified that could have been improved on it (or even that I actually improved something if the task was about refactoring or improving a feature).

If they ask me something very specific about a language or framework, try to capture the concept that is being asked, and avoid the actual details and implementations on that technology if I am not familiar with it.

Try to explain the concept and how I think it works based on my own experiences and self intuition while dodging from the technology implementation of the concept itself.

If any question can be theoretically explained, then try to explain it on theory as much as possible. Focus on WHAT not on HOW the thing works (as long as they do not ask how it works with some level of depth).

Must-know topics:
1. Relational databases (SQL), at least one service;
2. NoSQL, at least one service;
3. Messages (queues, consumers, etc), at least one service;
4. CRUD;
5. TDD;
6. Clean Code;
7. ORM (at least one library);
8. Unit tests;
9. CI/CD (concept at least);
10. DevOps (GitLab/GitHub workflows), must know at least one of them -> No need to know the core of it but must know what it is and how it works (stages, steps, pipeline, examples, etc);
11. IaC (Infrastructure as Code), must know to TALK about it, how I used it in my experiences e.g.: in my current job I use Terraform to create and configure resources on our cloud AWS environment;
12. Docker -> at least Dockerfile and Docker Compose;
13. Kubernetes;
14. Observability (concepts and what it is), must know at least one or two of the main services out there e.g.: NewRelic and Datadog;
15. Cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure, depends on what the company actually uses as provider) -> Even if I don't know specifically the products/services of the company providers, I can talk about how I know for one of these providers and that the company's provider offers the same thing as well and what is it's name e.g.: AWS S3 and GCP Storage.

Take one of my experiences and literally talk about what I did on that experience but as if I had done it in the tech stack they want (or maybe in both the stack I worked on and what the company wants).

If I don't know something in practice, it is safe for JR/PL positions to say "I know what it is, I have worked with it and used it as user level only, I unfortunately don't know it with greater depth because I actually did not configure and set those things up at the companies I worked on"

For these kinds of situations, it is great to ask GPT and do some research on what it is before the interview. Get some visual examples and try to understand what the thing is and what it does.

If there is a specific technology (language, framework, etc) question that I don't know how to answer, I can state that I did something really similar with the tech stack I worked on and then explain what I did. Finish saying that it would be easier to search on documentations and implement it on the technology they're asking about because I'm already familiar with the concept.

For scenarios where I might get asked "How did you implement this thing you mentioned?" and I don't know how to answer, I can say that I actually implemented something on it (a new feature, a bugfix, improvement, etc) although I didn't build it from ground-up because it was not my responsibility at the time.

Search for parallels in the tech stacks I know e.g.: key featuers of .NET and compare with the tech stack they want me to know, e.g.: NestJS.
Compare concepts, features, best practices, tools, etc.
