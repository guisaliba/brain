not about the knowledge you know, it's about questions. it's expected that you already know the stack you're supposed to work, it's all about the mindset of WHY and HOW.

it's expected that you deliver, but how fast? in which way? from which perspective/point-of-view? how the technology XYZ differs from ABC to deliver, what are the trade-offs, etc.

you gotta be confident, you gotta be sure that you already KNOW how to do stuff. it's about how fast you can do that stuff, and in the best way, with excellence.

mindset should be about the problem, and how to solve it. it doesn't matter the tech, what should be done to solve it? so it's important to showcase your adaptability and being comfortable choosing the best technology for the specific project's needs.

all of this will be based in your own experiences, so the most important part of those interviews is how you're going to link your professional experiences with all the confidence and showcasing.

### What to Say to Resemble the Company

Your goal is to present yourself as the perfect fit for a custom software development company. Frame your experience not just by the tech you used, but by the problems you solved.
#### **1. Emphasize Your Role as a "Solution Builder"**

FACSS doesn't build one product; it builds many solutions for different clients. Show that you thrive in that environment.

- **Connect to their core business:**
    > "I was particularly interested in FACSS because your focus is on **developing custom software**. My entire career has been about translating specific business needs—whether for a large e-commerce group, a major bank, or a city government—into robust and efficient technical solutions. I really enjoy the challenge of understanding a unique problem and building the right tool for it."
#### **2. Highlight Your Technical Versatility**

A custom software company loves engineers who are not tied to a single technology. Your diverse background is a major strength.

- **Showcase your adaptability:**
    > "Having worked professionally with both the **.NET ecosystem and the TypeScript/Node.js stack (using NestJS)**, I've become very adaptable. I'm comfortable choosing the best technology for the specific project's needs, rather than being limited to just one platform. I see you also offer IT training, which suggests a culture of learning, and I'm always eager to expand my skills, having also worked with Python and Go."
#### **3. Talk About the Full Project Lifecycle**

Show that you think beyond just writing a piece of code. Mention your experience with architecture and infrastructure, which is crucial for building reliable client solutions from the ground up.

- **Demonstrate ownership and architectural thinking:**
    
    > "My experience isn't just in back-end coding. I've been responsible for **designing system architectures** and managing the **AWS cloud infrastructure** that the applications run on. This end-to-end perspective helps me build solutions that are not only functional but also scalable and maintainable for the client in the long run."
#### **4. Mention Your Passion for Collaboration and Growth**

Your experience leading guilds connects perfectly with their secondary business of IT training. It shows you're a team player who elevates others.

- **Align with their training focus:**
    
    > "Something I'm also passionate about is knowledge sharing. At Banco Inter, I took the initiative to lead and restructure our developer guilds to help over 60 colleagues grow. I believe that a strong team builds the best software, and I enjoy mentoring and collaborating to find the best solutions."

#### **2. Questions About Technology and Growth**

These show you care about technical excellence and your own development.

- "Since you work on custom projects, how does the team decide on the technology stack for a new client? Is there an established set of tools, or is there flexibility to propose new ones?"
