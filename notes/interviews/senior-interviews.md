not about the knowledge you know, it's about questions. it's expected that you already know the stack you're supposed to work, it's all about the mindset of WHY and HOW.

it's expected that you deliver, but how fast? in which way? from which perspective/point-of-view? how the technology XYZ differs from ABC to deliver, what are the trade-offs, etc.

you gotta be confident, you gotta be sure that you already KNOW how to do stuff. it's about how fast you can do that stuff, and in the best way, with excellence.

mindset should be about the problem, and how to solve it. it doesn't matter the tech, what should be done to solve it? so it's important to showcase your adaptability and being comfortable choosing the best technology for the specific project's needs.
