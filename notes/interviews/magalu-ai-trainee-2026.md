## Scenario
O Magalu precisa abrir um novo CD no Nordeste para agilizar as entregas e a diretoria está em dúvida entre duas cidades: Recife e Salvador. Através de análises utilizando a inteligência artificial, defina:

1. Qual das duas cidades apresenta a localização mais estratégica para a empresa?
2. Quais são os principais fatores que sustentam essa decisão?
3. Quais ferramentas e metodologias foram utilizadas para fundamentar o seu case?

## Thought process
- Problema de decisão geográfica
- Análise de dados que serão levados em consideração:
	1. Custo imobiliário;
	2. Malha viária para logística de transporte de produtos;
	3. Potencial consumo nos estados vizinhos (economias locais e regionais)
	4. Escoamento de produtos para as principais capitais;
	5. Infraestrutura geográfica (ex.: tipos de energia, transporte, telecomunicação);
	6. Fiscalização e incentivo governamental;
- Construir um AI Agent para performar as análises necessárias
- O Agent precisa coletar os dados e informações necessários a fim de tomar uma decisão estratégica baseada na análise feita

## Action plan
### **Phase 1: Define the Decision Problem (The "Why")**
This is the most critical step. The agent's design depends entirely on the question you're trying to answer. You must be specific.

**Examples of well-defined problems:**

- **Business:** "What is the optimal city block to open a new specialty coffee shop in Lisbon, based on foot traffic, competition density, and local demographics?"
- **Real Estate:** "Which neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, offer the best investment potential for residential properties, considering school ratings, crime rates, and proximity to parks?"
- **Public Sector:** "Identify areas in a city that are "food deserts," lacking accessible grocery stores within a 1km radius of high-density residential zones."

**Task:**
1. **State Your Goal:** Clearly write down the one question you want to answer.
2. **Define Success Criteria:** What factors determine a "good" or "bad" location? (e.g., high profit, low crime, high accessibility).
3. **Identify Required Data Points:** List every piece of information you'll need (e.g., competitor locations, property prices, population density, public transport stops, etc.).
### **Phase 2: Data Acquisition (Web Scraping)**
This phase involves gathering the raw data identified in Phase 1.

**1. Identify Data Sources:**
- **Business Directories:** Google Maps, Yelp, Yellow Pages (for competitor locations, reviews).
- **Real Estate Websites:** Zillow, Redfin, local real estate portals (for property prices, neighborhood data).
- **Government & Public Data Portals:** Census websites (for demographics), city crime logs, public transit authorities.
- **Social Media/Forums:** Reddit or local forums can provide qualitative data about neighborhoods.

**2. Choose Your Tools (Python Stack):**
- **`requests`:** To send HTTP requests and get the raw HTML of web pages.
- **`BeautifulSoup4`:** To parse HTML and XML, making it easy to find and extract the data you need.
- **`Scrapy`:** For more complex, large-scale scraping projects that require handling multiple pages, following links, and managing data pipelines. Start with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

**3. Ethical Considerations:**
- **Check `robots.txt`:** Always check a website's `robots.txt` file (e.g., `www.example.com/robots.txt`) to see which parts of the site you are allowed to scrape.
- **Rate Limiting:** Make requests at a reasonable pace to avoid overloading the website's server. Introduce delays (`time.sleep()`) between requests.
- **API First:** Before scraping, always check if the website offers a public API. An API is a much more stable and legitimate way to get data.
### **Phase 3: Data Processing and Geocoding**
Raw scraped data is messy. It needs to be cleaned and structured.

**1. Cleaning and Structuring:**
- Use the **`pandas`** library to load your scraped data into DataFrames.
- **Tasks:** Remove duplicate entries, handle missing values (e.g., a business with no address), standardize formats (e.g., "Street" vs. "St.").
**2. Geocoding:**
- This is the process of converting street addresses into geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- **Tool:** Use the **`geopy`** library, which can connect to various geocoding services like OpenStreetMap (free) or Google Maps API (requires key).
- The output of this phase is typically a clean `.csv` file or a database table with columns for `name`, `address`, `latitude`, `longitude`, and other scraped attributes.
### **Phase 4: Geographical Analysis**
This is where you derive spatial insights from your geocoded data.
- **Core Tool:** **`GeoPandas`**. It's `pandas` for geospatial data and is the industry standard in Python.
- **Key Analysis Techniques:**
    - **Proximity Analysis:** Calculate distances between points. (e.g., "Find the nearest competitor for each potential location").
    - **Buffering:** Create a radius around points. (e.g., "Count how many schools are within a 2km radius of a property").
    - **Spatial Joins:** Combine different datasets based on their location. (e.g., Join your potential locations with a map of census tracts to get demographic data for each location).
    - **Heatmaps:** Visualize the density of points in an area.
### **Phase 5: The AI / Decision Model**
This is where the agent makes its recommendation. You can start simple and build complexity.

**1. Feature Engineering:**
- Create new, meaningful columns from your analysis. These are the "features" your model will use.
- **Examples:** `competitor_count_500m`, `avg_school_rating_1km`, `distance_to_nearest_metro`.

**2. Model Selection:**
- **Level 1: Weighted Scoring Model (Simple & Effective):**
    - Assign a weight (importance) to each feature.
    - Normalize all feature values (e.g., scale from 0 to 1).
    - Calculate a final "suitability score" for each location: `Score = (feature1 * weight1) + (feature2 * weight2) + ...`
    - The location with the highest score is the recommended one.

- **Level 2: Machine Learning Model (Advanced):**
    - If you have data on existing locations with known outcomes (e.g., successful vs. unsuccessful cafes), you can train a model.
    - **Tools:** **`scikit-learn`**.
    - **Model Type:** A regression model could predict a success metric (like future revenue), while a classification model could predict a category (like "high potential" vs. "low potential").

### **Phase 6: Visualization and Reporting**
The final results must be easy to understand.

- **Core Tool:** **`folium`** or **`plotly`**. These libraries allow you to create interactive maps in Python.
- **Your Goal:** Create a map that plots the locations you analyzed. Use colors or icons to represent their final scores (e.g., green for high-potential, red for low-potential). Add pop-ups with details for each location when clicked.
- This map is the final output of your agent.
