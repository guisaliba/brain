the Eigenfactor score is a metric developed to measure the total importance or influence of a scientific journal within the academic community.

it is based on the number of citations that journals receive, weighting citations by the influence of the journal. when a journal is citated on highly influential journals, that weights more heavily than those from less influential ones.

this reflects on how significant citations to a journal are, considering the prestige of the citing sources.
the sum of all journals' Eigenfactor scores sum to 100. so a journal with score 15.0 represents 15% of the total influence of all indexed journals (ranges 0 to 100)

Eigenfactor only looks at citations over a five-year span, exluding self-citations and can also assess the influence of individual authors and Google's PageRank algorithm.

there is also an Article Influence score, calculated by dividing the Eigenfactor by the number of articles published by one journal (the one whose articles are being analyzed).
