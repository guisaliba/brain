To every question, try to apply the S.T.A.R. framework: what was the designated task to me, what happened before (context) the task, what did I do to accomplish it (approach, hands-on, development and solution building) and then what was the result after I took action on it.

If something very specific about a language or framework is asked, try to capture the concept that is being asked, and avoid the actual details and implementations on the technology.

Try to explain the concept and how you think it works based on your experiences and intuition
