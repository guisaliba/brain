To every question, try to apply the S.T.A.R. framework: what was the designated task to me, what happened before (context) the task, what did I do to accomplish it (approach, hands-on, development and solution building) and then what was the result after I took action on it.

If something very specific about a language or framework is asked, try to capture the concept that is being asked, and avoid the actual details and implementations on the technology.

Try to explain the concept and how you think it works based on your experiences and intuition and dodge from the technology implementation of the concept itself.

If any question can be theoretically explained, then try to explain it on theory as much as you can. Focus on WHAT not on HOW the thing works (as long as they specifically do not ask how it works).

Must-know topics:
1. Relational databases (SQL), at least one service;
2. NoSQL, at least one service;
3. Messages (queues, consumers, etc);
4. CRUD;
5. TDD;
6. Clean Code;
7. ORM (at least one library);
8. Unit tests;
9. CI/CD (concept at least);
10. Git flows (GitLab/GitHub devops workflows), must know one of them -> Must ask GPT how to do it, no need to know the core of it but what it is and how it works (stages, steps, pipeline, examples, etc);
11. IaC (Infrastructure as Code), must know to TALK about it, how I used it in my experiences e.g.: in my current job I use Terraform to create resources on our cloud AWS enviornment;
12. Docker -> at least Dockerfile, Docker Compose;
13. Kubernetes;
14. Observability (concepts and what it is), must know at least one or two of the main services out there e.g.: NewRelic and Datadog;
15. Cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure, depends on what the company actually uses as their cloud environment) -> Even if I don't know specifically the products/services of the company providers, I can talk about how I know for one of these providers and that the company's provider has it as well and what is it's name e.g.: AWS S3 and GCP Storage.
